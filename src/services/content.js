Meet other Sheridan College students to gain and share experiences about studying software development at Sheridan College. Not sure what to expect during your co-op work terms? What about LeetCode and what to do with it? Or maybe how to ace interviews and land that internship? Our club leads have been through it all so don’t miss out on these exclusive events. Join our <link>Discord</link> to connect with other club members and stay up to date on all that’s happening. We welcome all Sheridan College students!    ",
